# Advent of Code 2023

OCaml solutions to as much of the 2023 Advent of Code as I can solve.

## Setup

This year's advent of code will be attempted in OCaml.

Rather than each day having its own directory with an executable script, I'm going to attempt to split my solution into `bin`, `src`, and `test` directories.

I'm primarily using Visual Studio Code as my IDE, but that might change to some Jetbrains IDE if I can get the ReasonML plugin to work correctly.

### Software versions

```sh
$ ocaml --version
The OCaml toplevel, version 5.1.0

$ dune --version
3.11.1

$ opam --version
2.1.5
```
